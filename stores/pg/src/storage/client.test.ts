/**
 * Regression coverage for the missing *client-level* 'error' handlers.
 *
 * pg removes the pool's idle 'error' listener from a client while it is
 * checked out (pg-pool `_acquireClient`) and only re-adds it on release. So a
 * checked-out client whose backend dies between queries (idle-TCP kill by a
 * pooler/NAT, `pg_terminate_backend`, backend restart) emits 'error' on the
 * Client with no listener attached, which Node escalates to an
 * uncaughtException that crashes the host process. PoolAdapter must guard
 * every checkout it hands out (`connect()` and `tx()`).
